## Introduction
* This project aims to analyze the Coffee Sales data using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).
* The objective is to understand sales trends and identify patterns to guide decision-making.

## What is EDA?
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) involves analyzing data sets to summarize their main characteristics.
* It often includes visualizations to uncover patterns, trends, and relationships.
* In this analysis, we explore the sales data of Coffee products.

## Library Used
This project utilizes various Python libraries for data analysis and visualization.
The libraries used are:
* **Pandas:** For data manipulation and analysis.
* **NumPy:** For numerical operations and array manipulation.
* **Matplotlib:** For creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations.
* **Seaborn:** For statistical data visualization.
* **Plotly Express:** For creating interactive plots.
The following code demonstrates how these libraries are imported into the Python environment:
```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

import plotly.express as px
```
